Repo is for random python projects.

Advent of Code Challenge:

Created in 2015, it presents a series of coding challenges that can be performed in any language. My language of choice is Python (in the future I hope to complete the challenge in Golang also).
I decided to work on this challenge to improve my coding skills and also I don't have many projects that appeal to me at the moment.
